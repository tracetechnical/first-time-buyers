# Help to Buy ISA
1) Where you can, deposit the maximum allowed each month and prioritise this over personal savings to maximize your gov't bonus.
1) The "Help To Buy Scheme" IS NOT related to the "Help To Buy ISA". The "Help To Buy Scheme" is available on new builds only at the time of writing, wheras the ISA can be used on any property within certain value limits.

# Savings
1) Keep a fallback fund before going into housebuying. Here are some of the things you may need money for at very short notice:
  - Sudden broken boiler
  - Roof leak
    etc
1) Keep an "emergency pot" for mortgage funds seperate from the above. 
   Should you end up without a job or in other financial difficulty, a mortgage pot will remove this huge burden from your shoulders to give you time to get back on your feet.
   Keep 1 months mortgage minimum, or more if that makes you feel safer.

# Making an offer
## Getting Ready
Before making an offer, ensure all your paperwork is in order and you have in mind a legal firm who you would like to use.
### Solicitors
Approach a few local solicitors and ask for a quote to provide conveyencing for your purchase. 3 is a pretty good number. The price they give will depend on the value of the property, among other things.
Use of a Help To Buy ISA will incur a small extra charge due to the paperwork they need to do to tie up all the loose ends.
Keep the quotes handy and check online for other peoples experiences with them.
If you are in Taunton, I can wholeheartedly recommend Porter Dodson solicitors who we have used several times now.
### Financial paperwork 
Get all your chickens in the house a week or so before you place your offer. Get your funds fairly well consolidated into bank accounts which you have ready access to statements for, paper or PDF.
You will need proof of funds for the deposit you want to put down. If you are using a help to buy ISA, you will need to provide proof of the balance of this.
Its worth making up a covering spreadsheet to send to the vendors estate agent detailing what part of the deposit is coming from where.
You can then mention the governement bonus if this makes up part of your proposed deposit.
The statements are needed to tie you back to the accounts and prove you own them.
### Mortgage Decision In Principle
You will need a decision in principle to be able to make an offer on a property. This document states how much the bank is willing to lend you, and when combined with your deposit, this should equal or exceed the price you are going to pay for the property.
If you want to buy a property for 300k and have a DiP for 270k, you will need to fork out a deposit of 30k. The Decision In Principle will be at a given minimum "LTV", which is the percentage the bank will lend you of the purchase price.
95% LTV means you need a minimum 5% deposit. You can still put in a 10% or higher deposit. The higher your deposit percentage, the lower the interest rate you pay and the more deals you have access to.
The deposit percentages for lowering of rates are stepped, and are normally 5%, 10%, 20% with no huge benefit inbetween these steps at the time of writing.
## Making the offetr
When you make the  offer, you should phone and speak to the estate agent and clearly state that you viewed the property in question (EG 123 springfield ave) and that you wish to put forward an offer.
The agent will then ask you what the offer you would like to make is. They will then go back to the seller and see if your offer is acceptable.
If you are buying alone or with someone else, agree the maximum you wish to pay for the property and stick to it.
Never pay more than the asking price, as this could end in a bidding war.
If you want to avoid competition, it can be appropriate to pay the asking price straight off to minimise the risks of being beaten by another offer.
Consider what would be a fair price to pay, if you're dropping 30k off a 250k house... chances are the vendors won't accept unless they are absolutely desperate to sell, and even then it is unlikely.
Be ready for your first offer to be rejected, and be ready with your next move to ensure the negotations move along swiftly.
## When the offer is accepted
When your offer is accepted, the agent will ask for proof of the following:
- Deposit funds
- Decision In Principle for your mortgage
- Residential address
- Identity
The proof of funds is for the deposit only, and the DiP will provide proof that the bank are willing to lend you the rest of the money in principle.
!!!YOU WILL NOT KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY WILL LEND YOU THE MONEY UNTIL YOU APPLY AND RECIEVE A FULL MORTGAGE OFFFER!!!

# If things go wrong
## Gut feel
## Before the offer is accepted
If you are certain you wish to withdraw from the purchase, phone the sellers agent to tell them.
Although this is disappointing for them, they are normally very supportive and will ask if there is anything else that could be negotiated to save the deal.
They do this in the interests of receiving their comission, but will try as hard as they can to keep the deal going.
## After the offer is accepted but before you have paid the solicitors initial fees
## After you have paid the initial fees but before searches have been ordered
## Once searches are back but before exchange
